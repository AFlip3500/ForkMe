ForkMe
========

This repository is an assignment for Polytechnic School's 2018-2019 Computer Science classes.

Instructions for Students
-------------------------

1. Fork this project into your own GitHub account. You now have a separate copy of the repository.
2. From your GitHub account, get the link that will allow you to clone your fork of the project onto your local computer.
3. On your local machine, open a Terminal and use git to create a clone of your forked version of the project. This is the version of the repository that you will work on when editing this project.
4. Your only assignment for the ForkMe project is this: in the `StudentDirectories` folder make a new directory with your studentID (lastnamefirstinitial), and place a text file `helloitsme.txt` in that directory.
5. Use git to add the new files and commit them to your local version of the project.
6. Push that new commit of the project to your fork on GitHub. You are the only one who has been working on your copy of the fork, so there shouldn't be any issues with updating your main branch.
7. Is your edit good enough to be incorporated into the developer's version of this project? Submit a *pull request* for your fork to be merged into the instructor's original version of the project. If approved, your work will become part of the project going forward.

Good luck!
